= SNOMED in Norway 

== Background 
Norway will test SNOMED-CT. First we would like to check the terms related to anatomical location and structure. 
In this directory there is an Excel sheet which maps the Norweigan codeset Volven-8352. This is used to define antatomical locations in the laboratory domain. 
The Excel sheet builds up the mapping to SNOMED-CT terms.
